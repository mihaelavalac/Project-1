# Recipe Generator

This project is created to help users with their recipes choice! The requirements of the project are to involve at least two API's and a different CSS framework (other than Bootstrap), I selected Bulma. This is one of my first large projects, and because I am a self learner, I wasn't able to build this application with a team, therefor I did it independently. The API's that I used are themealDB and thecocktailDB. The project offers users the opportunity to ether generate a random meal by selecting from a string of letters, or user can introduce the recipe name in the searchbox.  

The meal DB - https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

The cocktail DB - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
